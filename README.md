<strong>Rocketseat - Stage 03 / Desafio 02</strong>

I was supposed to develop an advanced form as a way of studying all the things I had learned so far about forms, considering accessibility and semantics.

I had the opportunity to use different kinds of inputs, such as text-area, checkbox, e-mail, date and time. I organized information on fieldsets and it was fun to do the setup and layout of a &lt;select&gt;. In the other hand, fixing the width and gap between data/time elements was a bit challenging.

The original layout was available for reference <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/8Y404aptrkvMy8jWjdlJkt/Stage-03---Formulário-avançado-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=kRzVswK5RpfpY90i-0">here</a>.
